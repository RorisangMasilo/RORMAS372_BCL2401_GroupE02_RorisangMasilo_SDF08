# Learning Reflections

## **SDF08 MVP Portfolio Website Project**

### Overview

In this project, I created an MVP for my portfolio focusing on responsive design. This involved applying various CSS techniques to achieve a responsive, aesthetically pleasing design with linked pages, as well as deployment.

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

- **Responsive Design**: I successfully implemented media queries to ensure the page looks decent on various re-sizing or devices and that naviagtion bar is responsive.
- **Styling Elements**: I was able to style my portfolio accordingly with CSS stylings in the various areas of effects.

#### Challenges Faced

- **Grid**: Adjusting layouts for the images in the portfolio were placed accordingly. I had to experiment with different approaches to ensure the design remained consistent and functional. Unfortunately, I settled with how they were displayyed, as I did not want to mess up the code.
- **Navigation bar**: Implementing interactive elements like hover and focus effects required more practice and research to get them right.

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: I want to explore more advanced CSS properties to enhance the user experience, whilst maintaing the design thinking or UI principles.

#### Overall Learning Experience

This project was an invaluable hands-on experience in applying UI principles, responsive designing with the mentality of design thinking techniques. It helped solidify my understanding of responsive design, CSS and its practical applications in web development.
